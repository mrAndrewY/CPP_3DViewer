\section{Introduction}
   
Viewing Tride! For the first time on screens: Wireframe as in The Wachowski Matrix. 
The program is as reliable as a Swiss watch. Tell your friends, your neighbors, your cat and your guinea pig. 
Let them all download and spin the models with us.

\section*{Installation}

Linux: make install.
Mac: make install.
Build/Calc installation folder by default.

\section{Usage}
       
See the fascinating Wireframe pseudoworld with your own eyes! An entire pseudoworld on your display!  
It knows how to save its settings in a file. It doesn't slow down on larger files than it should. 
Sorry, but it won't make you coffee. But it will make you quit what you're doing and start spinning models! 
You can customize the color and type of lines, background color and vertex color, and more. Create your own pseudoworld in your personal computer! 
To always stay with us, record a fascinating five-second GIF video clip of your pseudoworld!

\section{Deletion}
